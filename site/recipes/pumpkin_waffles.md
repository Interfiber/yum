## Ingredients
  - 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1 teaspoon baking soda
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
  - 1 teaspoon ground ginger
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
  - 4 large eggs, separated
  - 2 cups well-shaken buttermilk
  - 1 cup canned solid-pack pumpkin
  - 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) unsalted butter, melted
  - Vegetable oil for brushing waffle iron or cooking spray

## Make It!
Preheat oven to 250°F and preheat waffle iron. Sift together flour, 

brown sugar, baking powder and soda, salt, and spices. Whisk egg yolks 

in a large bowl with buttermilk, pumpkin, and butter until smooth. Whisk in dry ingredients just until combined.

In a mixing bowl with a whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites until 

they hold soft peaks (as in, far softer than the over-beaten whites 

you’ll see in my picture above). Folk them gently into the waffle 
batter, until just combined.

Brush waffle iron lightly with oil and spoon batter (about 2 cups for 

four 4-inch Belgian waffles) into waffle iron, spreading quickly. Cook according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Transfer waffles to rack in oven to keep warm and crisp. Make more 

waffles in same manner.
